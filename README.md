### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ 
It seems that you have landed on my github, please explore around and ask any questions that you might have

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating a vulnerability lab
- ğŸ““ I'm currently reading about vagrant boxes and the power that they hold
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning penetration testing
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything really, I'm not shy about learning anything I can ğŸ˜…
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Warhammer AoS and anything else even remotely considered nerdy
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Despite reading my entire life, spelling is still not my forte. Thank goodness for auto-correct ğŸ˜†
